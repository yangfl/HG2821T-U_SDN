# If you include "vfat" in the list of filesystem types, you *MUST* make    #
# sure all data is written to the medium before you remove it (e.g. run the #
# "sync" command in a terminal window).  Otherwise, you *WILL* lose data!   #

# WARNING!  Removing "sync" from the options is a very bad idea and

# Filesystem type specific mount options: This variable contains a space sepa-
# rated list of strings, each of which has the form "-fstype=TYPE,OPTIONS".
# If a filesystem with a type listed here is mounted, the corresponding

# For example, "-fstype=vfat,gid=floppy,dmask=0007,fmask=0117" would add the
# options "gid=floppy,dmask=0007,fmask=0117" when a vfat filesystem is mounted.
